# README for Setting up Docker-Compose for n8n

## Prerequisites

This guide will walk you through setting up n8n with Docker-Compose. No technical expertise is required, and we’ll break everything into simple steps.

## Step 1: Install Git

Git is a tool that helps manage files. Here’s how to get it:

### On macOS

1. Open the Terminal (you can find it by searching for "Terminal" on your Mac).
2. Type this command and press Enter to see if Git is already installed:

    ```bash
    git --version
    ```

If it’s not installed, type this command and press Enter:

    ```bash
    brew install git
    ```

Once it’s done, type this to confirm Git is installed:

    ```bash
    git --version
    ```

### On Windows

1. Visit [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com) and click "Download for Windows."
2. Open the downloaded file and follow the steps to install Git:
   - Select Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software when prompted.
   - The default options work for most users.
3. Once installed, open Command Prompt (search "Command Prompt" in the Start menu) and type:

   ```bash
   git --version
   ```

This will confirm Git is installed.

## Step 2: Install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

WSL allows you to run Linux commands on Windows, which is required for Docker to work seamlessly. Here’s how to install it:

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator (search "PowerShell" in the Start menu, right-click, and select "Run as Administrator").
2. Run the following command to install WSL:

   ```bash
   wsl --install
   ```

This will install the latest version of WSL and Ubuntu Linux.

Restart your computer if prompted.

After restarting, open PowerShell and check the version:

    ```bash
    wsl --version
    ```

Launch WSL by typing:

    ```bash
    wsl
    ```

This will open the Linux terminal.

## Step 3: Install Docker

### On macOS

1. Go to [docker.com](https://www.docker.com) and download Docker Desktop for Mac.
2. Open the downloaded file and drag Docker into your Applications folder.
3. Open Docker from the Applications folder and follow any setup instructions.
4. To confirm it’s working, open the Terminal and type:

   ```bash
   docker --version

docker-compose --version

On Windows

Go to docker.com and download Docker Desktop for Windows.

Run the installer and follow the steps:

Ensure the WSL 2 feature is enabled (Docker Desktop will prompt you to enable it if it’s not already).

Ensure "virtualization" is turned on in your computer’s settings (you might see this in your BIOS/UEFI).

Open Docker Desktop and ensure it’s running.

Open Command Prompt and type:

docker --version

docker-compose --version

Step 4: Check for Docker Compose

Docker Compose might already be installed as part of Docker Desktop. Here’s how to check:

macOS

Open the Terminal and type:

docker-compose --version

If it’s not installed, you can add it with this command:

brew install docker-compose

Windows

Docker Compose is included with Docker Desktop. To confirm, open Command Prompt and type:

docker-compose --version

Next Steps

Now that you’ve installed Git, WSL (for Windows), and Docker, you’re ready to set up Docker-Compose and start running n8n. Follow the next section of this guide for easy setup instructions.
